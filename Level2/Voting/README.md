## Getting Started :


Hello dear user !
The smart contract can be deployed on replit as well as remix IDE. Here I have shared images of how to work with the contract on remix IDE

<br/>You can compile the contract as shown in the image above

<br/>Once compiled successfully, choose any of the given dummy wallet address (meant for testing purpose) to deploy the smart contract

<br/>Once deployed you can see as per our code we have various fields to work upon

<br/> First the contract deployer (manager) needs to register the candidates (i.e. competing political parties by filling their wallet addresses, name as well as age which the number of working years in the field)
There after the manager needs to register the wallet address of eligible voters so that they can cast their votes.
Once the registrations are done, the manager can start the voting after which the registered voters cast vote to their prefered contestant. Once the voting is completed the manager should end the session by stopping the voting. 
Then click on the get winner button to get the address and name of the winner party
