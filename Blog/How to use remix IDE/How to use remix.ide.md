### Deploying Contract 
In order to deploy our smart contract we have to first compile it.

Then we can deploy it.

### Abi and ByteCode

You can find abi and bytecode in compilation menu.

You can click on abi and bytecode to copy them.

### Giving Input in Smart Contract 

After we have deployed our contracts as mentioned above we can go to deployed contracts option, we can see all of our attributes and functions there .

After we enter the value inside our function we can click on transact to input our function.
