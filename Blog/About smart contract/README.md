# Smart Contracts

---

### Smart contracts are one of the most important things in blockchain through which decentralization is achieved. These are programs that are stored on blockchain and are executed when the pre-determined rules are met. They are immutable computer programs that run deterministically.

### Smart contracts are typically written in a high-level language such as Solidity, Vyper, Rust. Solidity and Vyper are Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) compatible languages, which means they can be run on any blockchain that are based on EVM.

### In order to run the smart contracts, they must be compiled to low-level bytecode.

### Once compiled they are deployed on the blockchain using a special contract creation transaction.

### Each smart contract is identified by an address which is derived from the contract creation transaction. The address of the contract can be used in transaction as recipient for funds or calling one of the contract's functions.

### It is also worth noting that smart contracts are not executed "in parallel" in any sense, the blockchain is considered as single-threaded machine.

### It is important to note that contracts only run when a transaction is initiated by an externally owned account and remains dormant until a transaction triggers it's execution.

### Contracts can never run on their own or in the background. But a smart contract can be executed by an other contract which can be called by other contract and so on.

### Smart contracts are also used for creating token contracts. A token is representation of something in blockchain. This something can be money, time, services, etc. By representing things as tokens, we can create smart contracts to interact, interact, exchange or destroy them. "Sending tokens" actually means that calling a method of smart contract that someone wrote and deployed.

### Smart contracts also enable DeFi protocols. It reduces the cost for the organizations and consumers. The involvement of middlemam is ruled out, so smart contracts provide no oppurtunity for disputes between buyers and sellers.

### The main advantages of smart contracts are speed, transparency and security. Once the conditions are met, the smart contracts execute immediately and are automated. Also, the records of transactions are shared across participants there's no need to question whether information has been altered. The smart contract interaction is done using transaction, so transactions are usually encrypted in blockchain, which makes them very hard to hack just like any other transaction.

### The biggest advantage of smart contracts is also a disadvantage for it. Changing smart contracts are almost impossible. Any error in the contract cannot be fixed and we need to create a new contract to fix the error.

### Nowadays, smart contracts are powering the DeFi systems. This means a single loop hole can create considerable losses for consumers.

### Anonther significant disadvantage is that the blockchain is pretty much an isolated network. It cannot communicate the outside world. So, for smart contract, to get prior information regarding execution and conditions, it needs to get information from outside the network. To curb this challenge, oracles are developed which fetch data from outside.

### Smart contracts can be developed and deployed in different blockchain platforms. Several platforms offer distinctive features for developing smart contracts including contract programming languages, contract code execution, security levels.

### Smart contracts are undoubtedly the way forward for relatively basic contracts that can be written and executed. It will businesses worldwide time and money while also revolutionalizing how they interact with supply chain and their customers.

### Developers have a massive task of addressing these shortcomings faced by smart contracts. Smart contracts are hugely adopted if all improvements suggested are taken into place.
