# Smart Contract for CrowdFunding

### This is the best example of how smart contracts work, as it follows the if and then condition.

I've shown that anyone can create a campaign, and because there is no middleware or organisation, it is easily visible to the general public.

It has some functionalities, such as allowing the user to set a time limit for the target to be met or else the funds will be returned to the contributors, which is how smart contracts work.

Functions in this contract:

- createRequests -> Users will be able to start a new crowdfunding project by entering campaign details such as the title, story, and goal amount to be raised.
- View Project ->users can view all of the existing projects and campaign details.
- Make Donation -> Anyone can donate to a project they want to support.
