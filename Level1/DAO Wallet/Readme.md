# Smart Contract DAO Wallet (Multi Signature Wallet)

## Project Description

In a decentralized organization when a decision needs to be taken it is not solely depend on a single member but a group of people, and depending upon the votes of the majority of owners the decision is confirmed. In this contract I have implemented the similar conncept that is, to confirm the transaction we need to have an upvote of the majority of the owners.
