# Level 1

Level 1 is mainly a sub-folder of the SOLIDITY-PATHSHALA-MAIN. It contains a smart contract[SendTo_Eather.sol](https://github.com/Vikash-8090-Yadav/Solidity-Pathshala/blob/main/Level1/sendTo_Eather/SendTo_Eather.sol) which is used to send ether from one account to the other. This smart Contract alows us to payto another contract, fetch balance and also gives the address of the payable user.
